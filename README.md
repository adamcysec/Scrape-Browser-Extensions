# Scrape-Browser-Extensions

This repo contains python scrips for scraping all visible extensions browsers Chrome and Edge.

The scripts output a CSV file containing the extension id and the extension name with the following fields:
`id`, `name`

You can view the CSV data zipped in directory [/extension data/](https://github.com/adamcysec/Scrape-Browser-Extensions/tree/main/extension%20data)

## Why scrape browser extensions?

### Malicious Extensions

Malicious browser extensions typically steal user data or visit advertisment related links in the background. 

I suggest reading this article from brave.com about malicious broswer extensions - [brave.com/learn/browser-extension-safety/#is-it-safe-to-use-browser-extensions](https://brave.com/learn/browser-extension-safety/#is-it-safe-to-use-browser-extensions)
